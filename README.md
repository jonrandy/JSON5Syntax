# JSON5Syntax

Simple JSON5 Syntax for Sublime Text.

This was originally created by putting the [JSON5 grammar from Atom](https://github.com/wiredmax/language-json5/blob/master/grammars/json5.cson) through [this converter](https://pitkley.dev/blog/atom-grammar-to-sublime-syntax/). The result seems to be okay, but it may not be perfect.

Feel free to fix any issues you might find!
